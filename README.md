# Getting Started with Cortex Analyst
# BUILD London Bootcamp Edition!

This is an special repository for BUILD London 2025 to make sure this can be run in less than 1h 15m which is the duration of the Bootcamp for Cortex Analyst. 

This is the source code repository for the accompanying [Getting Started with Cortex Analyst](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/getting_started_with_cortex_analyst/index.html) Quickstart which is available on [quickstarts.snowflake.com](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com). Please refer to the quickstart for step by step explanations but follow this guide here in order to complete the bootcamp for BUILD session.

We are going to use Snowflake GIT integration in order to accelerate the execution of some tasks (create DB, load data, etc) that are needed before going deeper into Cortex Analyst. Also this repository simplify some of the requirements of the original repository as for simplicity we are using just the ADMINISTRATOR account. This is not recommended but we just want to concentrate on the Cortex Analys piece for this short Bootcamp.
